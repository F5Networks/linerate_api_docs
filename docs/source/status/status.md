## Overview

The nodes in the /status path contains information about the system that is
not persistent, like statistics and dynamically generated or computed
information. This is analogous to show commands in the CLI. This hierarchy is
read-only, so PUTs, POSTs, and DELETEs will fail.

## /status

The nodes below this one let you view configurations or statistics. This node
only helps organize the nodes below it.

If you do not see a page here for a /status node, you can find related
information in the corresponding /config page.
