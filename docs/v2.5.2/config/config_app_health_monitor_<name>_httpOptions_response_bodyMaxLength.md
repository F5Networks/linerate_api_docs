## /config/app/health/monitor/<name>/httpOptions/response/bodyMaxLength

â€‹Use

Maximum number of bytes of the response body to be checked for a match. This
applies to both exact matches and regex matches.

### Parameters

name: Name of health monitor object

### Data Key

The data key contains the number of bytes to check.

Note: When the default key is set to true, it means the object is set to its
default. In this case, the system works as follows:

  * On a PUT operation, the system ignores the data key. (Applicable only to /config nodes.)
  * On a GET operation, the response only contains "default": True and does not contain the data key.
  * If the object has a base, it inherits its setting from its base.

See [Setting Objects to Their Default](https://docs.lineratesystems.com/093Rel
ease_2.5/250REST_API_Reference_Guide/000Getting_Started_with_the_REST_API/300U
nderstanding_the_REST_Hierarchy#Setting_Objects_to_Their_Default_(Default_Key)
).

#### Data Type

uint32

#### Default Data Value

0

An object uses the default data value when one of the following is true:

  * For objects without bases--When the object's default key is true.
  * For objects with bases--When the object's default key is true, and when the default key is true for all of the object's bases.

### Default Allowed

True

### Request Methods

GET, PUT
