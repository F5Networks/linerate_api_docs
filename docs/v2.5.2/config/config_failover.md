## /config/failover

The nodes below this one perform the functions described in this function
overview.

Use

Use to create a failover group that you attach to CARP interfaces. Failover
groups complement CARP groups. Failover groups provide failover protection for
a complete path from clients that use a specific virtual IP to the web servers
accessed by that virtual IP. Failover groups provide failover protection for
the path on a single F5速 LineRate速 system, while CARP groups provide failover
protection for one segment of the path across multiple F5速 LineRate速 systems.

For a failover group example, see [Failover Group Example](https://docs.linera
tesystems.com/093Release_2.5/200CLI_Reference_Guide/Configure_Commands/Failove
r_Mode_Commands/Failover_Group_Example).
