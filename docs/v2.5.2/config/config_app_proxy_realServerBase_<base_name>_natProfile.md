## /config/app/proxy/realServerBase/<base_name>/natProfile

Use

Use to enable the built-in NAT profile for TCP connections. This lets the
system use the client's IP address as the source IP address when establishing
connections.

For an active/active configuration (as described in [this example](https://doc
s.lineratesystems.com/093Release_2.5/200CLI_Reference_Guide/Configure_Commands
/Interface_Mode_Commands/200CARP_Example_-
_Active%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FActive)), you cannot use the client-source-
address NAT profile. Using this NAT profile would not permit the real server
to know which F5速 LineRate速 system to send traffic back to, because the real
server would only know the client's IP address not the IP address of the F5速
LineRate速 system.

### Parameters

base_name: Name of real server base

### Data Key

The data key contains the name of the NAT profile. The available, predefined
profile is called client-source-address. The data key value should be:

"builtin: client-source-address"

Note: When the default key is set to true, it means the object is set to its
default. In this case, the system works as follows:

  * On a PUT operation, the system ignores the data key. (Applicable only to /config nodes.)
  * On a GET operation, the response only contains "default": True and does not contain the data key.
  * If the object has a base, it inherits its setting from its base.

See [Setting Objects to Their Default](https://docs.lineratesystems.com/093Rel
ease_2.5/250REST_API_Reference_Guide/000Getting_Started_with_the_REST_API/300U
nderstanding_the_REST_Hierarchy#Setting_Objects_to_Their_Default_(Default_Key)
).

#### Data Type

string

#### Default Data Value

""

An object uses the default data value when one of the following is true:

  * For objects without bases--When the object's default key is true.
  * For objects with bases--When the object's default key is true, and when the default key is true for all of the object's bases.

### Default Allowed

True

### Request Methods

GET, PUT
