## /config/restServer/details/sessionIdleTimeout

Close login session if there is no activity in the specified amount of time.

Use

The system uses a persistent cookie, so you stay logged in until the specified
time elapses or until you log out of the REST server. F5速 LineRate Manager,
the GUI for F5速 LineRate速, also uses the REST server for access, and this
timeout also applies to idle time in F5速 LineRate Manager.

### Data Key

The data key contains the number of seconds.

Note: When the default key is set to true, it means the object is set to its
default. In this case, the system works as follows:

  * On a PUT operation, the system ignores the data key. (Applicable only to /config nodes.)
  * On a GET operation, the response only contains "default": True and does not contain the data key.
  * If the object has a base, it inherits its setting from its base.

See [Setting Objects to Their Default](https://docs.lineratesystems.com/087Rel
ease_2.6/250REST_API_Reference_Guide/000Getting_Started_with_the_REST_API/300U
nderstanding_the_REST_Hierarchy#Setting_Objects_to_Their_Default_(Default_Key)
).

#### Data Type

double

#### Default Data Value

0.0

An object uses the default data value when one of the following is true:

  * For objects without bases--When the object's default key is true.
  * For objects with bases--When the object's default key is true, and when the default key is true for all of the object's bases.

### Default Allowed

True

### Request Methods
